# 🎙️ Aura – Python Voice Assistant (SOC-Oriented Project)

Aura is a modular Python-based voice assistant designed to perform everyday tasks using speech recognition and text-to-speech.  
The project is built as a learning-focused implementation with a long-term vision of evolving into a Security Operations Center (SOC) voice assistant.

This repository currently represents the foundational version of the project, focused on Python fundamentals, clean structure, and voice-driven automation.

## 🚀 Current Features

- 🎤 Voice input using microphone  
- 🔊 Text-to-speech responses  
- 🌐 Google search using voice commands  
- 📺 YouTube search using voice commands  
- 🕒 Time queries  
- 😂 Random jokes  
- ❌ Exit and stop command handling  

---

## 🧠 Project Motivation

This project was created to:

- Strengthen Python programming fundamentals  
- Learn modular project structure  
- Understand voice-based automation  
- Build a strong base for future SOC-focused automation  

Instead of being a generic voice assistant, Aura is designed with a security automation mindset.

## 📂 Project Structure
    src/
    ├── aura.py # Main entry point
    ├── speech.py # Handles speech input and output
    ├── commands.py # Processes user commands and logic
    └── utils.py # Helper functions (search, time, etc.)

## 🎤 Example Voice Commands

    -“What is the time?”
    -“Tell me a joke”
    -“Search Python speech recognition”
    -“Watch cybersecurity videos on YouTube”
    -“Exit”

## 🔐 Future Scope: SOC-Oriented Expansion

  The long-term goal of this project is to extend Aura into a voice-assisted SOC automation tool.
  
  Planned future enhancements include:
  
    - 🧾 Voice-based SOC queries (e.g., “Any failed logins today?”)
    - 📊 Parsing Windows Event Logs and Sysmon data
    - 🚨 Voice alerts for suspicious activity
    - 🔗 Integration with SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk)
    - 🧠 Assisting junior SOC analysts through guided voice responses
  
  These features will be developed incrementally as the project evolves.
